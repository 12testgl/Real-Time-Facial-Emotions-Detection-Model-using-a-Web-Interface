# Data Mining and Analysis Project--Real-Time-Facial-Expressions-Detection-using-a-Web-Interface-in-Python
# Description
The Human facial expressions are important for visually expressing a lot more information. Facial expression recognition is essential in the field of human-machine interaction. Automated facial recognition systems have many applications, including understanding of human behavior, diagnosing mental disorders, and synthetic human expression. Identifying facial expressions through computers with high detection rates is still a challenging task.

Computer animated agents and robots bring new dimension in human computer interaction which makes it vital as how computers can affect our social life in day-to-day activities. Face to face communication is a real-time process operating at a a time scale in the order of milliseconds. The level of uncertainty at this time scale is considerable, making it necessary for humans and machines to rely on sensory rich perceptual primitives rather than slow symbolic inference processes.

In this project we are presenting the real time facial expression recognition of seven most basic human expressions.We have used a variety of intensive deep learning techniques (convolutional neural networks) to identify the main seven universal human emotions: 
I. Neutral II. Angry III. Disgust IV. Fear V. Happy VI. Sadness VII. Surprise
