# Data Mining and Analysis Project--Real-Time-Facial-Expression-Detection-using-a-Web-Interface-in-Python

# Description
The Human facial expressions are important for visually expressing a lot more information. Facial expression recognition is essential in the field of human-machine interaction. Automated facial recognition systems have many applications, including understanding of human behavior, diagnosing mental disorders, and synthetic human expression. Identifying facial expressions through computers with high detection rates is still a challenging task.

Computer animated agents and robots bring new dimension in human computer interaction which makes it vital as how computers can affect our social life in day-to-day activities. Face to face communication is a real-time process operating at a a time scale in the order of milliseconds. The level of uncertainty at this time scale is considerable, making it necessary for humans and machines to rely on sensory rich perceptual primitives rather than slow symbolic inference processes.

In this project we are presenting the real time facial expression recognition of seven most basic human expressions.We have used a variety of intensive deep learning techniques (convolutional neural networks) to identify the main seven universal human emotions: 

I. Neutral II. Angry III. Disgust IV. Fear V. Happy VI. Sadness VII. Surprise

# Problem
#### For any real time image taken from our camera, our goal is to predict the expression of the face in that image out of seven basic human expression.

# Project Formulation

The hands on building this project of Facial Expression Recognition is divided into following tasks/steps:-

#### A.	Task 1: Introduction 
•	Introduction to the dataset

•	Import essential modules and helper functions from NumPy, Matplotlib, and Keras.

#### B.	Task 2: Exploring the Dataset
•	Display some images from every expression type in the Emotion FER dataset.

#### C.	Task 3: Generating Training and Validation Batches
•	Generate batches of tensor image data with real-time data augmentation.

•	Specify paths to training and validation image directories and generates batches of augmented data.

#### D.	Task 4: Creating a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Model
•	Design a convolutional neural network with 4 convolution layers and 2 fully connected layers to predict 7 types of facial expressions.

•	Used Adam as the optimizer, categorical crossentropy as the loss function, and accuracy as the evaluation metric.

#### E.	Task 5: Training and Evaluating Model
•	Training the CNN by invoking the model.fit() method.

•	Used ModelCheckpoint() to save the weights associated with the higher validation accuracy.

•	Observed live training loss and accuracy plots in Jupyter Notebook for Keras.

#### F.	Task 6: Saving and Serializing Model as JSON String
•	Used to_json(), which uses a JSON string, to store the model architecture.

#### G.	Task 7: Creating a Flask App to Serve Predictions
•	We used the open-source code from "Video Streaming with Flask Example" to create a flask app to serve the model's prediction images directly to a web interface.

#### H.	Task 8: Creating a Class to Output Model Predictions
•	Created a FacialExpressionModel class to load the model from the JSON file, load the trained weights into the model, and predict facial expressions.

#### I.	Task 9: Designed an HTML Template for the Flask App
•	Designed a basic template in HTML to create the layout for the Flask app.

#### J.	Task 10: Used Model to Recognize Facial Expressions at the Real Time using laptops webcamera
•	We than run the main.py script to create the Flask app and serve the model's predictions to a web interface.

•	Applied the model for real time recognition of facial expresssions of users using webcam of the Laptop.
